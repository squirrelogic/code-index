# Tasks: Pluggable Embedding Layer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-add-a-pluggable/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Following TDD principles - tests written FIRST and must FAIL before implementation (Principle VI)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root (from plan.md line 105-140)

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Embedding Generation with Default Model (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable developers to generate embeddings for their codebase using the default all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model without any configuration

**Independent Test**: Run embedding command on a sample codebase and verify that vector representations are generated and stored successfully

### Tests for User Story 1

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Incremental Re-embedding Based on Changes (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable developers to re-embed only changed portions of their codebase, avoiding unnecessary recomputation for large projects

**Independent Test**: Modify specific files, run embedding command, and verify that only chunks with changed hashes are re-embedded

### Tests for User Story 2

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Model Selection Override (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable power users to use a specific embedding model instead of the default, for better quality or different embedding dimensions

**Independent Test**: Run embed command with different model overrides and verify that the specified models are used

- [ ] T062 [US3] Add model listing functionality to show available models: `code-index embed --list-models`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 2, AND 3 should all work - users can override the default model

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Dry-Run Mode for Planning (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable developers to preview what would be embedded without actually performing the computation, useful for understanding scope of changes

**Independent Test**: Run embed command with dry-run flag and verify that no actual embeddings are generated but a detailed report is provided

### Tests for User Story 4

- [ ] T063 [P] [US4] Contract test for `--dry-run` flag behavior in `tests/contract/embed-command.test.ts`: no database changes (contracts/cli-embed-command.yaml lines 306-311)

- [ ] T069 [US4] Add `--dry-run` flag to embed command (contracts/cli-embed-command.yaml lines 25-31)
- [ ] T070 [US4] Format dry-run output per contract specification (contracts/cli-embed-command.yaml lines 113-130)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1-4 should all work - users can preview changes before committing resources

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 + US2 (P1 priority) should be completed first for MVP
  - US3 + US4 (P2 priority) can follow
  - US5 (P3 priority) is optional for extensibility
- **Testing (Phase 8)**: Depends on implementation of stories being tested
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Works with US1+US2 models
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Analysis-only, no embedding required
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Completely independent adapter implementation

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Models before services
- Services before CLI commands
- Core implementation before enhancements
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Core models (T012, T013, T014) can run in parallel
- Error types and utilities (T016, T017, T018, T019) can run in parallel after T015

#### Phase 3: User Story 1
- All tests (T026-T030) can run in parallel
- ONNX adapter and factory (T031-T033) can run in parallel

#### Phase 4: User Story 2

#### Phase 5: User Story 3
- All tests (T053-T056) can run in parallel

#### Phase 6: User Story 4
- All tests (T063-T065) can run in parallel

#### Phase 7: User Story 5
- All tests (T071-T075) can run in parallel
- Hosted adapter and resilient wrapper (T076, T077) can run in parallel

#### Phase 8: Testing
- All test implementations (T084-T092) can run in parallel

#### Phase 9: Polish
- All documentation tasks (T093-T096) can run in parallel
- All CLI enhancement tasks (T097-T100) can run in parallel
- All additional feature tasks (T101-T104) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (write first, ensure they fail):
Task T026: "Contract test for code-index embed command exit codes"
Task T027: "Contract test for code-index embed output format"
Task T028: "Integration test for basic embedding workflow"
Task T029: "Unit test for ONNX adapter initialization"
Task T030: "Unit test for ONNX adapter embedding generation"

# Then launch model implementations together:
Task T031: "Implement OnnxEmbeddingAdapter class"
Task T032: "Implement ONNX model loading and inference logic"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Embedding)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Incremental Updates)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US2 independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready - this is a complete MVP with core functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Basic embedding works! (Initial release candidate)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Incremental updates work! (MVP complete - production ready)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Model selection works! (Enhanced flexibility)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Dry-run mode works! (Better UX)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Custom adapters work! (Enterprise ready)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:
- Developer A: User Story 1 + User Story 2 (P1 priority, core MVP)
- Developer B: User Story 3 + User Story 4 (P2 priority, enhancements)
- Developer C: User Story 5 (P3 priority, extensibility)
- All developers: Phase 8 Testing (comprehensive validation)
- Team together: Phase 9 Polish (documentation and final touches)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD discipline)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Performance targets from spec.md success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010)
- Constitution Principle I partial compliance: Hosted adapters (P3) are optional and isolated
- All paths assume single project structure per plan.md
