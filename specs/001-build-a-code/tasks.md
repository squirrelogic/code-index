# Tasks: Code-Index CLI Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-code/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/cli-interface.yaml (complete)

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL and not explicitly requested in the feature specification. This task list excludes test tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Package name**: @squirrelogic/code-index
- **Command name**: code-index

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories 1-3 (Phase 3-5)**: Core MVP - depend on Foundational, can then run sequentially
- **User Stories 4-6 (Phase 6-8)**: Enhancements - depend on core MVP stories
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Initialize - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Index - Depends on US1 (needs initialized project)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Search - Depends on US2 (needs indexed database)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Refresh - Depends on US2 (extends indexing)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Doctor - Depends on US1 (checks initialization)
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Uninstall - Depends on US1 (removes what init created)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational model tasks (T010-T012) can run in parallel
- All utility implementations (T015-T017) can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Within stories, most tasks are sequential due to file dependencies

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 1 Setup - Parallel Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies in parallel:
Task T003: "Install production dependencies"
Task T004: "Install development dependencies"
```

### Phase 2 Foundational - Parallel Models
```bash
# Create all models in parallel:
Task T010: "Create CodeIndexEntry model"
Task T011: "Create SearchResult model"
Task T012: "Create HealthCheckResult model"

# Create all utilities in parallel:
Task T015: "Implement file utilities"
Task T016: "Implement JSON lines logger"
Task T017: "Implement output formatter"
```

### Phase 9 Polish - Parallel Documentation
```bash
# Add all documentation in parallel:
Task T064: "Add --help documentation"
Task T065: "Implement --version flag"
Task T067: "Optimize database queries"
Task T069: "Validate all exit codes"
```

5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Search)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core functionality end-to-end
7. Publish MVP to npm if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Can initialize projects
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Can index codebases
