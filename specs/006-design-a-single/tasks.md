# Tasks: Optimized Database Schema for Code Index Storage

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-design-a-single/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/schema-interface.yaml (complete)

**Tests**: No explicit testing requirements in the specification - tests are optional for this feature.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project structure per plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for files table (via foreign key)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run parallel with US1/US2 (different tables)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 (files) and US2 (symbols) via foreign keys
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on meta table (created in Foundational) for migration tracking
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after US2 complete (depends on symbols table)

### Within Each User Story

- SQL schema definitions (migrations) before TypeScript interfaces
- TypeScript interfaces before repository implementations
- Repository core methods before query optimization
- Repository implementations before logging/monitoring
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T007) marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks (T011, T013-T014) marked [P] can run in parallel within Phase 2
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - US1 (T015-T016) can start in parallel
  - US3 (T033) can start in parallel (independent table)
  - US2 must wait for US1 files table (T015 complete) due to foreign key dependency
- Within user stories:
  - US1: T015-T016 can run in parallel (both modify same migration file but different sections)
  - US2: T022-T025 can run in parallel (modify same migration, different table sections)
  - US4: T039-T043 can run in parallel (modify same migration, different table sections)
- All Polish tasks (T074-T079) marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch schema and index definitions together (modifying same migration file):
Task: "Complete files table schema in sql/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql"
Task: "Add files table indexes in sql/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql"
# Note: These modify the same file but different sections (table DDL vs indexes)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T014) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T015-T021) - File tracking
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T022-T032) - Symbol indexing and xrefs
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T033-T038) - Full-text search
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready - MVP complete!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Files only)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Files + Symbols)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Files + Symbols + Search) - MVP!
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Add embeddings)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Add migrations)
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Add call graph)
8. Complete Polish ‚Üí Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T014)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T015-T021) - Files
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (T033-T038) - Search (independent)
   - Developer C waits for US1 complete, then starts User Story 2 (T022-T032) - Symbols
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or different sections of same file, no runtime dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No tests explicitly requested in spec - all test tasks omitted
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts with runtime dependencies, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Task Summary

- **Total tasks**: 82
- **Setup phase**: 7 tasks
- **Foundational phase**: 7 tasks
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 7 tasks (Files)
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: 11 tasks (Symbols + Xrefs)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: 6 tasks (Search)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: 15 tasks (Chunks + Embeddings)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: 12 tasks (Migrations + Logging)
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: 8 tasks (Call Graph)
- **Polish phase**: 9 tasks

**MVP Scope** (P1 stories only): Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2 + US3 = 38 tasks

**Parallel opportunities**: 15 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases
