# Feature Specification: Advanced Language Parsing with Structured Code Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `004-integrate-tree-sitter`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Integrate Tree-sitter with language loaders for TypeScript/JavaScript and Python. Expose a parser module returning: path, language, symbol, kind, span, parents, signature, doc, imports/exports, calls, comments, hash. Include fast error handling for partial parses. Non-goals: full type-checker."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Parse and Extract Code Symbols (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to extract structured information from their TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python files. They use the parser module which analyzes source files and returns detailed information about each symbol including its name, type (function, class, variable), location in the file, and parent scope. This enables intelligent code search and navigation.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that provides the foundation for all code intelligence features - without symbol extraction, advanced search and navigation are impossible.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by parsing sample files and verifying correct extraction of functions, classes, variables, and their hierarchical relationships.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a TypeScript file with classes and functions, **When** parsed, **Then** all symbols are extracted with correct names, kinds, and spans
2. **Given** a JavaScript file with nested functions, **When** parsed, **Then** parent-child relationships are correctly identified
3. **Given** a Python file with classes and methods, **When** parsed, **Then** method signatures and class hierarchies are extracted
4. **Given** a file with syntax errors, **When** parsed, **Then** valid symbols before the error are still extracted

---

### User Story 2 - Extract Import/Export Relationships (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to understand module dependencies in their codebase. The parser identifies all import and export statements, tracking which modules depend on others and what symbols are exposed. This enables dependency analysis and helps identify unused exports or circular dependencies.

**Why this priority**: Critical for understanding code structure and dependencies, enabling features like unused code detection and dependency graphs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by parsing files with various import/export patterns and verifying correct extraction of module relationships.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a TypeScript file with ES6 imports, **When** parsed, **Then** all imported modules and symbols are identified
2. **Given** a JavaScript file with CommonJS requires, **When** parsed, **Then** required modules are correctly extracted
3. **Given** a Python file with import statements, **When** parsed, **Then** imported modules and specific imports are identified
4. **Given** a file exporting multiple symbols, **When** parsed, **Then** all exported symbols are catalogued with their types

---

### User Story 3 - Extract Documentation and Comments (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to index documentation alongside code. The parser extracts JSDoc comments, Python docstrings, and inline comments, associating them with the relevant code symbols. This enables documentation-aware search and helps maintain code understanding.

**Why this priority**: Enhances code understanding and searchability but not essential for basic parsing functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by parsing files with various documentation formats and verifying correct association with code elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a TypeScript function with JSDoc, **When** parsed, **Then** documentation is extracted and linked to the function
2. **Given** a Python class with docstrings, **When** parsed, **Then** class and method documentation is correctly extracted
3. **Given** inline comments throughout code, **When** parsed, **Then** comments are captured with their line locations
4. **Given** malformed documentation, **When** parsed, **Then** parser continues without failing

---

### User Story 4 - Track Function Calls and Usage (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to understand how functions are used throughout their codebase. The parser identifies function calls, method invocations, and variable references, creating a usage graph that shows where each symbol is referenced.

**Why this priority**: Enables advanced features like "find all references" and call hierarchy analysis, valuable but not core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by parsing files with function calls and verifying correct identification of call sites and targets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file with function calls, **When** parsed, **Then** all call sites are identified with called function names
2. **Given** method chaining in JavaScript, **When** parsed, **Then** entire call chain is correctly extracted
3. **Given** Python method calls, **When** parsed, **Then** object methods and static calls are distinguished
4. **Given** dynamic or computed calls, **When** parsed, **Then** parser handles gracefully without failing

---

### User Story 5 - Generate Content Hashes for Change Detection (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to efficiently detect when code elements change. The parser generates stable hashes for each symbol based on its content, enabling quick detection of modifications without full file comparison.

**Why this priority**: Optimization feature for change detection, useful but not essential for core parsing functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by parsing files, modifying specific symbols, and verifying hash changes only for modified elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a parsed file, **When** symbol semantic content unchanged, **Then** hash remains stable across parses
2. **Given** a function body modification, **When** reparsed, **Then** only that function's hash changes
3. **Given** whitespace or comment changes only, **When** reparsed, **Then** symbol hashes remain unchanged (semantic content unchanged)
4. **Given** identical semantic content in different files, **When** parsed, **Then** equivalent symbols have same hashes

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when parsing extremely large files (10MB+)?
- JSX/TSX files are supported as distinct language variants with dedicated parsers
- What happens with malformed or incomplete syntax? (Covered by syntax-level error recovery)
- How does parser handle Unicode and special characters in identifiers?
- What happens when parsing minified or obfuscated code?
- How does system handle files with conflicting or ambiguous syntax?
- What happens when language version features aren't supported?
- How does parser handle macro expansions or preprocessor directives?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12

- Q: When a syntax error is encountered mid-file, what level of error recovery should the parser attempt? → A: Syntax-level recovery - Skip malformed statements/expressions, continue parsing next top-level constructs (recommended for indexing use case)
- Q: What is the complete set of symbol kinds that the parser must recognize and distinguish? → A: Comprehensive - function, class, variable, interface, enum, type alias, constant, method, property, module, namespace, parameter, import/export, decorator/annotation
- Q: What output format should the parser module use for returning parse results? → A: Plain objects - Plain JavaScript objects matching TypeScript interfaces (recommended for performance and simplicity)
- Q: What should the hash calculation include to ensure stable change detection? → A: Semantic content - Include symbol signature and body structure, but exclude whitespace and comments (recommended for change detection)
- Q: How should the parser handle JSX/TSX files and other language variants? → A: Language variants - Treat JSX/TSX as distinct languages with their own Tree-sitter parsers (recommended for real-world codebases)
