# Feature Specification: Code Intelligence Protocol Server

**Feature Branch**: `010-expose-an-mcp`
**Created**: 2025-01-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Expose an MCP server with tools: search(q, dir?, lang?, k?), find_def(symbol), find_refs(symbol), callers(symbol), callees(symbol), open_at(path,line), refresh(paths?), and symbols(path?). Transport: stdio. Responses return anchors and short previews. Include simple auth toggle (off by default). Acceptance: works from Claude Code tool picker."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Code Search Integration (Priority: P1)

A developer using an AI assistant wants to search their codebase through natural language queries and receive relevant code snippets with file locations.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables AI assistants to understand and navigate codebases, providing immediate value for code exploration and understanding.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting an AI client, executing search queries, and verifying that relevant code snippets with file anchors are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a codebase with indexed content and the server running, **When** a client sends a search query "find database connection", **Then** the server returns matching code snippets with file paths, line numbers, and previews
2. **Given** the server is integrated with an AI tool, **When** the tool requests search results, **Then** the server responds with properly formatted results that the tool can display
3. **Given** a search with optional parameters, **When** the client specifies directory, language, or result count, **Then** the server filters results accordingly

### User Story 2 - Symbol Navigation and Definition Finding (Priority: P1)

A developer needs to navigate code by finding symbol definitions, references, and understanding code relationships through call graphs.

**Why this priority**: Essential for code comprehension and navigation, allowing developers to understand code structure and dependencies through their AI assistant.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by querying for various symbols and verifying correct definitions, references, and call relationships are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a symbol name in the codebase, **When** the client requests its definition, **Then** the server returns the exact location where the symbol is defined with a code preview
2. **Given** a function or class name, **When** the client requests references, **Then** the server returns all locations where the symbol is used
3. **Given** a function name, **When** the client requests callers or callees, **Then** the server returns the call hierarchy with locations and previews

---

### User Story 3 - File Navigation and Opening (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to navigate directly to specific code locations and view file contents at particular lines.

**Why this priority**: Enables precise navigation to code locations identified through search or analysis, improving workflow efficiency.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting specific file locations and verifying correct content is returned with appropriate context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file path and line number, **When** the client requests to open that location, **Then** the server returns the code at that location with surrounding context
2. **Given** a file path without a line number, **When** the client requests file content, **Then** the server returns the file content or an appropriate portion
3. **Given** an invalid path or line number, **When** the client requests that location, **Then** the server returns a clear error message

---

### User Story 4 - Index Refresh and Management (Priority: P2)

A developer modifies code and wants the search index to reflect recent changes without restarting the server.

**Why this priority**: Ensures search results remain current as code changes, maintaining accuracy without service interruption.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by modifying files, triggering refresh, and verifying updated content appears in subsequent searches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** files have been modified, **When** the client triggers a refresh for specific paths, **Then** the index updates for those paths only
2. **Given** no paths are specified, **When** the client triggers a refresh, **Then** the entire index is refreshed
3. **Given** a refresh is in progress, **When** new queries arrive, **Then** the server continues serving requests using the current index

---

### User Story 5 - Symbol Listing and Exploration (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to explore available symbols in files or across the codebase to understand code structure.

**Why this priority**: Useful for code exploration and discovery but not essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting symbol lists for various scopes and verifying comprehensive symbol information is returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a specific file path, **When** the client requests symbols, **Then** the server returns all symbols defined in that file
2. **Given** no path is specified, **When** the client requests symbols, **Then** the server returns a summary of symbols across the codebase
3. **Given** symbol information is requested, **When** returned, **Then** each symbol includes its type, name, and location

---

### User Story 6 - Optional Authentication (Priority: P3)

An administrator wants to restrict access to the code intelligence server in shared environments.

**Why this priority**: Security feature for specific deployment scenarios but not required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling authentication and verifying only authorized clients can access server functions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** authentication is disabled (default), **When** any client connects, **Then** full access is granted without credentials
2. **Given** authentication is enabled, **When** a client connects without credentials, **Then** access is denied with an authentication error
3. **Given** authentication is enabled, **When** a client provides valid credentials, **Then** full access is granted

### Edge Cases

- What happens when searching for extremely common terms that would return thousands of results?
- How does the server handle malformed or invalid symbol names?
- What happens when multiple clients connect simultaneously?
- How does the server respond when the index is corrupted or unavailable?
- What happens when file paths contain special characters or spaces?
- How does the server handle very large files that might overwhelm response limits?
- What happens when a client disconnects unexpectedly during a long-running operation?
- How does the server handle circular dependencies in call graphs?
- What happens when authentication credentials are invalid or expired?
