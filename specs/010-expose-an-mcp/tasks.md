# Tasks: Code Intelligence Protocol Server

**Feature**: 010-expose-an-mcp
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-expose-an-mcp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/mcp-tools.yaml

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Install MCP SDK dependencies: `npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod`

- [ ] T005 Implement line truncation in `src/services/preview-formatter.ts` (150 char max, smart centering on match)
- [ ] T006 Implement code anchor generation in `src/services/preview-formatter.ts` (file:line:col format for VSCode compatibility)
- [ ] T007 Add binary file detection and special character sanitization in `src/services/preview-formatter.ts`
- [ ] T008 Create `src/services/mcp-server.ts` with MCP Server initialization (Server class, capabilities declaration, StdioServerTransport)
- [ ] T009 Implement graceful shutdown handler in `src/services/mcp-server.ts` (SIGTERM, SIGINT, stdin end/close)
- [ ] T010 Configure SQLite for concurrency in `src/services/mcp-server.ts` (WAL mode, NORMAL synchronous, 64MB cache, readonly flag)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Search)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Symbol Nav)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run in parallel with Phase 3
- **Phase 5 (US3 - File Nav)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run in parallel with Phase 3, 4
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Refresh)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run in parallel with Phase 3, 4, 5
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Symbols)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run in parallel with other stories
- **Phase 8 (US6 - Auth)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run in parallel with other stories
- **Phase 9 (CLI)**: Depends on at least Phase 3 + 4 (MVP user stories)
- **Phase 10 (Testing)**: Depends on all implementation phases
- **Phase 11 (Docs)**: Depends on Phase 10 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Search)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1 - Symbol Nav)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2 - File Nav)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Refresh)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P3 - Symbols)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 6 (P3 - Auth)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each Phase

- Setup tasks T001-T003 can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks must be sequential (each builds on previous infrastructure)
- User Story 1 tasks must be sequential within the story
- User Story 2 tasks T019-T022 can run in parallel (different tools), T023-T024 must follow
- User Story 3 tasks must be sequential
- User Story 4 tasks must be sequential
- User Story 5 tasks must be sequential
- User Story 6 tasks must be sequential
- CLI tasks must be sequential
- Testing tasks T048-T054 can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks T056-T058 can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

Once Foundational (Phase 2) is complete:
- All 6 user stories (Phases 3-8) can be developed in parallel by different team members
- Testing (Phase 10) can begin as soon as individual user stories complete
- Documentation (Phase 11) can begin in parallel with testing

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After T004-T007 complete (preview-formatter.ts):
# Launch in parallel:
Task T008: Create mcp-server.ts with MCP Server initialization
Task T009: Implement graceful shutdown handler
Task T010: Configure SQLite for concurrency
Task T011: Implement prepared statement caching
Task T012: Setup logging infrastructure
```

---

## Parallel Example: After Foundational Complete

```bash
# After Phase 2 complete, launch all user stories in parallel:
Task T013-T018: User Story 1 (Search) - Developer A
Task T019-T024: User Story 2 (Symbol Nav) - Developer B
Task T025-T028: User Story 3 (File Nav) - Developer C
Task T029-T033: User Story 4 (Refresh) - Developer D
Task T034-T038: User Story 5 (Symbols) - Developer E
Task T039-T043: User Story 6 (Auth) - Developer F
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only - P1 Priority)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T012) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Search (T013-T018)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Symbol Navigation (T019-T024)
5. Complete Phase 9: CLI Integration (T044-T047)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test search + symbol navigation independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready - this is a functional MVP

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation**: Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Infrastructure ready
2. **MVP Release**: Add US1 + US2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Basic search + symbol nav)
3. **Enhancement 1**: Add US3 + US4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (+ File nav + Refresh)
4. **Enhancement 2**: Add US5 + US6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (+ Symbol listing + Auth)
5. Each release adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy (6 developers)

With 6 developers:

1. **Week 1**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together (critical path)
2. **Week 2**: Once Foundational complete, split into 6 parallel streams:
   - Dev A: User Story 1 (Search)
   - Dev B: User Story 2 (Symbol Nav)
   - Dev C: User Story 3 (File Nav)
   - Dev D: User Story 4 (Refresh)
   - Dev E: User Story 5 (Symbols)
   - Dev F: User Story 6 (Auth)
3. **Week 3**: Stories integrate and test independently
4. **Week 4**: CLI integration, testing, documentation

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- **[Story]** label (US1-US6) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group of related tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Performance targets: Search <500ms, Symbol nav <200ms, 50+ concurrent requests
- All responses MUST include file anchors and code previews (FR-009)
- Result limits: Max 100 results per query, max 10 lines per preview (FR-018)
- Authentication disabled by default (FR-013)
- Server operates completely offline (Constitution Principle I)
