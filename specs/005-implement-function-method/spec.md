# Feature Specification: Intelligent Code Chunking for Granular Indexing

**Feature Branch**: `005-implement-function-method`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement function/method-level chunking that keeps leading docstrings/comments and enclosing context (class/module). Provide language-specific queries (TS/JS + Python). Output stable chunk IDs via content hash. Acceptance: identical content â†’ identical chunk IDs across runs."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Function-Level Code Chunks (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to break down their code files into meaningful, searchable chunks at the function and method level. The chunking system divides each file into logical units centered around functions and methods, preserving their documentation and context. This enables more precise search results and better code understanding.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables granular code indexing and search - without proper chunking, search results include entire files which reduces precision.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing sample files and verifying functions/methods are correctly chunked with their documentation and context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a TypeScript file with multiple functions, **When** chunked, **Then** each function becomes a separate chunk with its JSDoc comments
2. **Given** a Python class with methods, **When** chunked, **Then** each method is chunked with its docstring and class context
3. **Given** a JavaScript file with nested functions, **When** chunked, **Then** inner functions maintain their enclosing function context
4. **Given** identical function content in different files, **When** chunked, **Then** both produce the same chunk ID
5. **Given** a function modified only in whitespace, **When** rechunked, **Then** chunk ID remains stable

### User Story 2 - Preserve Documentation and Context (Priority: P1)

A developer wants code chunks to include relevant documentation and surrounding context for better understanding. Each chunk includes leading comments, docstrings, and information about the enclosing class or module, making chunks self-contained and comprehensible when viewed in isolation.

**Why this priority**: Critical for maintaining code understanding - chunks without context or documentation lose important information needed for comprehension.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying chunks include JSDoc/docstrings and class/module context information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a function with JSDoc comments, **When** chunked, **Then** the chunk includes the complete JSDoc block
2. **Given** a Python method in a class, **When** chunked, **Then** the chunk includes class name and method docstring
3. **Given** a method with multi-line comment above it, **When** chunked, **Then** the comment is included in the chunk
4. **Given** a function in a module, **When** chunked, **Then** module-level context is preserved in chunk metadata

### User Story 3 - Generate Stable Chunk Identifiers (Priority: P1)

A developer wants consistent chunk identification across multiple indexing runs. The system generates stable chunk IDs based on content hashing, ensuring that identical code always produces the same ID regardless of when or where it's processed. This enables reliable chunk tracking and deduplication.

**Why this priority**: Essential for incremental indexing and change detection - without stable IDs, the system cannot efficiently track what has changed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing the same code multiple times and verifying identical chunk IDs are generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** identical function content, **When** processed multiple times, **Then** same chunk ID is generated each time
2. **Given** a function with only whitespace changes, **When** hashed, **Then** chunk ID remains unchanged
3. **Given** a function with code changes, **When** rehashed, **Then** a different chunk ID is generated
4. **Given** identical functions in different files, **When** chunked, **Then** both have the same chunk ID

---

### User Story 4 - Query Chunks by Language (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to search and filter chunks based on programming language. The system provides language-specific query capabilities that understand the syntax and patterns of TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python, enabling more accurate and relevant search results.

**Why this priority**: Enhances search precision by leveraging language-specific patterns, but basic chunking can function without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing language-specific queries and verifying correct chunk retrieval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** TypeScript chunks in the index, **When** querying for interfaces, **Then** only interface chunks are returned
2. **Given** Python chunks, **When** querying for class methods, **Then** method chunks with class context are returned
3. **Given** JavaScript chunks, **When** querying for arrow functions, **Then** arrow function chunks are correctly identified
4. **Given** mixed language codebase, **When** filtering by language, **Then** only chunks from specified language are returned

---

### User Story 5 - Handle Edge Cases Gracefully (Priority: P3)

A developer wants the chunking system to handle unusual code structures without failing. The system processes edge cases like empty functions, functions without documentation, very large functions, and malformed code gracefully, always producing valid chunks or clear error information.

**Why this priority**: Improves robustness but not essential for core functionality with well-formed code.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested with various edge case files and verifying system handles them appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a function without documentation, **When** chunked, **Then** chunk is created with empty documentation field
2. **Given** an extremely large function (1000+ lines), **When** chunked, **Then** entire function is still captured in single chunk
3. **Given** malformed syntax, **When** processing, **Then** partial chunks are created where possible
4. **Given** a file with no functions, **When** chunked, **Then** module-level chunk is created

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens with anonymous or lambda functions?
- How are class constructors and static methods handled?
- What happens with functions defined inside other functions?
- How does system handle decorators and function wrappers?
- What happens with very large functions that exceed size limits?
- How are async/generator functions treated?
- What happens when documentation is between functions rather than above?
- How does system handle preprocessor directives or conditional compilation?
