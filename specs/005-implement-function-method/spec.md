# Feature Specification: Intelligent Code Chunking for Granular Indexing

**Feature Branch**: `005-implement-function-method`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement function/method-level chunking that keeps leading docstrings/comments and enclosing context (class/module). Provide language-specific queries (TS/JS + Python). Output stable chunk IDs via content hash. Acceptance: identical content → identical chunk IDs across runs."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: If documentation changes content (not just whitespace), should the chunk ID change? → A: Normalize whitespace only - documentation content changes trigger new chunk ID
- Q: Should inner functions be separate chunks or embedded within their parent chunk? → A: Inner functions are part of parent chunk - only top-level functions/methods are separate chunks
- Q: What specific chunk types should be recognized in the taxonomy? → A: Extended types: function, method, constructor, property, class, module, async_function, async_method, generator
- Q: What information should be included in enclosing class/module context? → A: Names + signatures - class name, inheritance, method signature, module path
- Q: How should the system handle extremely large functions (e.g., 10,000+ lines)? → A: No hard limit - chunk entire function but log warning for functions over 5,000 lines

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Function-Level Code Chunks (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to break down their code files into meaningful, searchable chunks at the function and method level. The chunking system divides each file into logical units centered around functions and methods, preserving their documentation and context. This enables more precise search results and better code understanding.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables granular code indexing and search - without proper chunking, search results include entire files which reduces precision.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing sample files and verifying functions/methods are correctly chunked with their documentation and context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a TypeScript file with multiple top-level functions, **When** chunked, **Then** each function becomes a separate chunk with its JSDoc comments and module path
2. **Given** a Python class with methods, **When** chunked, **Then** each method is chunked with its docstring, class name, and inheritance chain
3. **Given** a JavaScript function with nested inner functions, **When** chunked, **Then** inner functions are included within the parent chunk as a single unit
4. **Given** identical function content in different files, **When** chunked, **Then** both produce the same chunk ID
5. **Given** a function modified only in whitespace, **When** rechunked, **Then** chunk ID remains stable

### User Story 2 - Preserve Documentation and Context (Priority: P1)

A developer wants code chunks to include relevant documentation and surrounding context for better understanding. Each chunk includes leading comments, docstrings, and information about the enclosing class or module, making chunks self-contained and comprehensible when viewed in isolation.

**Why this priority**: Critical for maintaining code understanding - chunks without context or documentation lose important information needed for comprehension.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying chunks include JSDoc/docstrings and class/module context information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a function with JSDoc comments, **When** chunked, **Then** the chunk includes the complete JSDoc block
2. **Given** a Python method in a class, **When** chunked, **Then** the chunk includes class name, inheritance chain, method signature, and method docstring
3. **Given** a method with multi-line comment above it, **When** chunked, **Then** the comment is included in the chunk
4. **Given** a function in a module, **When** chunked, **Then** module path and namespace hierarchy are preserved in chunk context

---

### User Story 3 - Generate Stable Chunk Identifiers (Priority: P1)

A developer wants consistent chunk identification across multiple indexing runs. The system generates stable chunk IDs based on content hashing, ensuring that identical code always produces the same ID regardless of when or where it's processed. This enables reliable chunk tracking and deduplication.

**Why this priority**: Essential for incremental indexing and change detection - without stable IDs, the system cannot efficiently track what has changed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing the same code multiple times and verifying identical chunk IDs are generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** identical function content, **When** processed multiple times, **Then** same chunk ID is generated each time
2. **Given** a function with only whitespace changes (no doc changes), **When** hashed, **Then** chunk ID remains unchanged
3. **Given** a function with documentation content changes, **When** rehashed, **Then** a different chunk ID is generated
4. **Given** a function with code logic changes, **When** rehashed, **Then** a different chunk ID is generated
5. **Given** identical functions in different files, **When** chunked, **Then** both have the same chunk ID

---

### User Story 4 - Query Chunks by Language (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to search and filter chunks based on programming language. The system provides language-specific query capabilities that understand the syntax and patterns of TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python, enabling more accurate and relevant search results.

**Why this priority**: Enhances search precision by leveraging language-specific patterns, but basic chunking can function without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing language-specific queries and verifying correct chunk retrieval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** TypeScript chunks in the index, **When** querying for async functions, **Then** only async_function type chunks are returned
2. **Given** Python chunks, **When** querying for class methods, **Then** method chunks with class context are returned
3. **Given** JavaScript chunks, **When** querying for constructors, **Then** constructor type chunks are correctly identified
4. **Given** mixed language codebase, **When** filtering by chunk type (generator), **Then** only generator chunks are returned
5. **Given** class-based code, **When** querying for properties, **Then** property type chunks are returned with class context

---

### User Story 5 - Handle Edge Cases Gracefully (Priority: P3)

A developer wants the chunking system to handle unusual code structures without failing. The system processes edge cases like empty functions, functions without documentation, very large functions, and malformed code gracefully, always producing valid chunks or clear error information.

**Why this priority**: Improves robustness but not essential for core functionality with well-formed code.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested with various edge case files and verifying system handles them appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a function without documentation, **When** chunked, **Then** chunk is created with empty documentation field
2. **Given** an extremely large function (10,000+ lines), **When** chunked, **Then** entire function is captured in single chunk with warning logged
3. **Given** a function with 5,000+ lines, **When** chunked, **Then** warning is logged but chunking completes successfully
4. **Given** malformed syntax, **When** processing, **Then** partial chunks are created where possible
5. **Given** a file with no functions, **When** chunked, **Then** module-level chunk is created

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens with anonymous or lambda functions?
- Constructors are chunked as type 'constructor', class properties as type 'property'
- Functions defined inside other functions are included within parent chunk (not separate)
- How does system handle decorators and function wrappers?
- Large functions (5,000+ lines) are chunked entirely with warning logged; no hard size limit
- Async/generator functions are recognized as distinct types (async_function, async_method, generator)
- What happens when documentation is between functions rather than above?
- How does system handle preprocessor directives or conditional compilation?

- Documentation typically appears immediately before or within function definitions
- Content-based hashing provides sufficient uniqueness for chunk identification
- Language syntax follows standard conventions for each supported language
- Whitespace normalization is acceptable for hash generation
- Users want function-level granularity rather than statement-level
- Class and module context (names, signatures, inheritance) is valuable for understanding methods without full parent code
- Source files are syntactically valid in most cases
- Top-level functions and class methods are the natural chunk boundaries (inner functions stay with parent)
