# Feature Specification: Hybrid Search Ranking System

**Feature Branch**: `009-implement-hybrid-ranking`
**Created**: 2025-01-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement hybrid ranking: BM25 (FTS5) + vector similarity + small tie-breakers (identifier/path/lang). Pipeline: lexical@200 ∪ vector@200 → fused top-k with path diversification. Parameters α/β/γ configurable. Output: file:line anchors with previews and scores. SLA: <300ms for top-10 on medium repos."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Hybrid Search (Priority: P1)

A developer searches for code using natural language or keywords and receives highly relevant results that combine both textual matching and semantic understanding.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides immediate value by improving search accuracy beyond simple text matching or pure semantic search alone.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing searches with various queries and verifying that results combine both lexical matches and semantically similar code, returning relevant results within performance constraints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a codebase with indexed content, **When** a user searches for "parse JSON data", **Then** results include both exact text matches for "parse" and "JSON" as well as semantically related code like JSON deserialization functions
2. **Given** a search query with technical terms, **When** the user searches, **Then** the system returns results within 300ms for the top 10 results
3. **Given** search results are returned, **When** the user views them, **Then** each result shows the file path, line number, a code preview, and a relevance score

### User Story 2 - Configurable Ranking Weights (Priority: P2)

A power user wants to adjust the balance between lexical matching, semantic similarity, and other ranking factors to optimize for their specific use case.

**Why this priority**: Different codebases and search patterns benefit from different ranking strategies. Configurability enables users to optimize for their specific needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adjusting configuration parameters and verifying that search result rankings change accordingly, with more weight given to the specified factors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** default ranking parameters, **When** a user increases the lexical weight parameter, **Then** exact text matches appear higher in results
2. **Given** configurable parameters α/β/γ, **When** a user adjusts these values, **Then** the ranking formula immediately reflects the new weights
3. **Given** a configuration change, **When** the same search is repeated, **Then** result ordering changes to reflect the new weights while maintaining performance requirements

---

### User Story 3 - Path Diversification in Results (Priority: P2)

A developer searching for common functionality wants to see results from different parts of the codebase rather than many similar results from the same file or directory.

**Why this priority**: Prevents result clustering from a single source, giving users a broader view of relevant code across the repository.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by searching for common patterns and verifying that results are distributed across different files and directories rather than concentrated in one area.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple matches in the same file, **When** search results are returned, **Then** the system limits results from any single file to promote diversity
2. **Given** matches across different directories, **When** results are ranked, **Then** results from different paths are interleaved rather than grouped
3. **Given** a highly repetitive codebase, **When** searching for common patterns, **Then** results show examples from various modules/components

---

### User Story 4 - Advanced Tie-Breaking (Priority: P3)

When primary ranking signals produce similar scores, the system uses intelligent tie-breakers based on code structure, file paths, and programming language characteristics.

**Why this priority**: Improves result quality when main ranking signals are close, but isn't essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by searching for queries that produce many similarly-scored results and verifying that tie-breakers properly order them.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** results with similar combined scores, **When** tie-breaking is applied, **Then** matches in function/class names rank higher than matches in comments
2. **Given** equally relevant results, **When** ordering final results, **Then** files in primary source directories rank higher than test or documentation files
3. **Given** results in different programming languages, **When** the query suggests a specific language context, **Then** results in that language are prioritized

---

### User Story 5 - Performance Monitoring and Optimization (Priority: P3)

A system administrator wants to monitor search performance and ensure the system meets SLA requirements across different repository sizes.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the system remains performant as it scales, but monitoring is less critical than core search functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing searches on repositories of various sizes and verifying performance metrics are collected and SLA requirements are met.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a medium-sized repository (10,000-50,000 files), **When** any search is performed, **Then** top-10 results are returned in under 300ms
2. **Given** search operations are performed, **When** viewing system metrics, **Then** performance data shows query time, ranking time, and result retrieval time
3. **Given** a slow query is detected, **When** reviewing logs, **Then** detailed timing breakdowns identify the bottleneck (lexical search, vector search, or ranking fusion)

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when one ranking component (lexical or vector) returns no results?
- How does the system handle queries that are purely navigational (searching for a specific file/function name)?
- What happens when the lexical and vector components return completely disjoint result sets?
- How does the system handle very short queries (1-2 characters) or very long queries (full paragraphs)?
- What happens when configuration parameters are set to extreme values (e.g., α=0 or β=1)?
- How does path diversification work when all matches are in a single file?
- What happens when the system cannot meet the 300ms SLA due to repository size?
- How does the system handle special characters or code syntax in search queries?
